## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to adjust size of background images using aspect-ratio and background-size elements

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
    .two-columns{
        display:grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
        width: 120rem;
        max-width: 90%;
        height: auto;
        padding:0;
    }
```


### Continued development

I could use this component in some other projects because this is useful and responsive.
